    As a Bullard Postdoctoral Research Fellow, I am collaborating with Dr. Jacek Gwizdka at the Information eXperience (IX) Lab. My research leverages neuro-physiological evidence to deepen our understanding of human-information interaction. As part of my fellowship, I plan to explore the use of real-time cognitive load detection algorithms in applied contexts.

    I currently collaborate with Learning, Innovation, & Technology Lab at Harvard University, to explore the relationship between joint visual attention and joint mental effort in collaborative learning environments by conducting a data analysis of eye tracking datasets.
    I also collaborated with Clemson University to detect cognitive load in real-time using pupillary activity.
    I also built models to estimate the rate of change of the academic web using archived copies of web pages.
    
    I was a Teaching Assistant for the following courses.
