- title: RAEMAP
  term: 2019 - present
  description: |-
    Real-Time Advanced Eye Movements Analysis Pipeline (RAEMAP) is an advanced pipeline to analyze traditional positional gaze measurements as well as advanced eye gaze measurements. 
    The implementation of RAEMAP includes real-time analysis of fixations, saccades, gaze transition entropy, ambient/focal viewing coefficient, and real-time measure of cognitive load. 
    RAEMAP provides visualizations of generated advanced gaze measures in real-time.

- title: Analyze Performance of Adolescents with ADHD Using Eye-Tracking
  term: 
  description: |-
    Conducted a pilot study to assess audiovisual Speech-In-Noise (SIN) performance of adolescents with ADHD compared to age-matched controls using eye-tracking measures. 
    Found that some signal-to-noise ratios shifts noise to a point where processing of speech becomes less automatic and relies more on increased cognitive load.
